## About this website

This prototype is for demonstrating the idea of a solution to serve a need that has been validated through user testing with Re-Entrants at Partners for Progress (and job seekers and Case Managers from other service providers).

## What does “alpha” mean?
The alpha stage of product development is a short phase after a deep discovery in which teams quickly design, build, and test concepts with users.

The aim of the alpha phase is to:

1. Show that project is technically feasible
2. Build and test early versions of a product with real users
3. Gather feedback from stakeholders and key partners to identify improvements for a beta release
In other words: this prototype is a work-in-progress... and we want your help making it better.

## Project Principles

The goal of this tool are to:

-Alleviate recidivism and increase successful re-entrants into the workforce pool of job ready workers...

-Serve the emotional needs of re-entrants who may be frustrated and overwhelmed entering this process...

-Reduce the demand on case managers to provide common information of document gathering for potential independent job seekers.

## Design Principles
1. Design for real-time job readiness determination, managing job search expectations, and detailed instruction for agency interactions for accessing resources and needed documents...
2. Model how providers would collect data to verify against other government systems when possible.
3. Work to connect people to the programs they want and need, in as few steps as possible...
4. Give applicants the option to complete multiple tracks at once or to perform one track while informing them of other programs available to them.
5. Mobile-first responsive design...
Ensure that people can utilize tool on all devices by designing first for small screens and low bandwidth.
6. Plain language, warm voice, and motivating tone...
7. These programs are complicated and re-entry to employment is emotionally stressful. Do the hard work to keep the wording deadly simple. Use a conversational, encouraging tone and show people where they are in the process at all times.
7. Fewer prompts per screen...
Ask people questions in small bite-sized chunks, so as not to overwhelm with multiple complex questions at any single step. Always let people know where they are in the process.
8. Personalize and tailor applications...
Only show applicants information related to their specific circumstance.
